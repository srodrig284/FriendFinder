### FriendFinder is a full-stack site. It's very basic but very good practice with creating a full-stack website.
 
### FriendFinder basically a dating app.  You answer 10 questions to get feeling for who would be your best match. It takes your survey answers and compares them to those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 
### Don't worry.  This is not real.  Just have fun with it.

### Future Development
    - Change the current questions.
    - Add more ways to match with a friend.
    - Add user authentication to be able to 
        - update account information
        - update answers to questions
